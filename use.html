      <h3>Merging</h3>
          <p> Spectral similarity between two spectra (top mirror plot) can be used to address three questions: 1) Whether two spectra are identical (bottom middle), using all peaks for similarity calculation, 2) whether the top spectrum is contained in the bottom spectrum (bottom left), discarding unmatched peaks in the bottom spectrum, or 3) whether the bottom spectrum is contained in the top spectrum (bottom right), discarding unmatched peaks in the top spectrum. The spectral angle (SA) is highlighted in red for each of the three cases. Peaks used to calculate the spectra angle are highlighted in red for each case.</p>
      <h3>Scores</h3>
      <p>Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient (PCC) and (normalized) spectral (contrast) angle (SA) are used as similarity measures in the USE. Although both measures correlate well, we(18) and others(32) have previously observed that the spectral angle offers higher sensitivity to differentiate similar spectra, while most users will be more familiar with PCC.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The web tool can not be used completly independently of a service called <a href='https://github.com/kusterlab/use_proxy'>use_proxy</a>. This is due to the fact that not all endpoints of the USI providers (such as JPOST, MassIVE, PeptideAtlas, PRIDE and ProteomeCentral) are served via https.
          ProteomicsDB hosts the UniversalSpectrumExplorer and uses TLS (https) to encrypt the communication with the user and host the web application. Unfortunately, all major browsers disallow communication from originally encrypted sources to other websites that do not provide a TLS communication channel.
          ProteomicsDB does not want to compromise with its communication and hosting policy and provides a simple proxy that wraps requests to all endpoints.
          We are happy to remove this <em>workaround</em> when all resources embrace encrypted communication.</li>
        <li>We are using the ProXI service to automatically route USI request to the correct endpoint, but as this service is still under active development, we can&#39;t guarantee 100% compatibility.</li>
